I knew ever since you showed me that one tiktok of that guy who coded his gf a website this was ineviable.. so here it is! Even though it isn\'t as great as that one, this actually took a lot more time than I thought.. I forgot everything about web development sooooo anyway this was a brain refresher :D. Anyway.. as you may have already been able to tell.. I included some POLAROID memories of some of our moments together, and if you click them you will see a little short comment on each of them! The hearts.. tbh I\'m not too sure what to do with them yet. BUT, I am thinking of having them be a surprise, and I\'ll add some random things for you here and there(maybe set a release date for each heart popup HAHAHAHAH. Thought u could get 5 QCCS that easily?!?! This first heart unlocked will be a classic LETTER! I am literally typing this in the closet as you are dead asleep on my bed, and I know this gift.. is a bit late but I hope you like it!! Its quite short and if I could slowly add more things over the course of a while I think it could have a lot fun little quirky things! Anyway, enough of talking about random shEET, I just wanted to tell you agane that I am very happy to have YOU judy TANG as my beautiful girlfriend, and through the rough patches we had I know we\'ll only grow from it and become a dynamic DUO! I love you very much and thanks for making my weekends something I always look forward to <3\n\n-Seman')" data-delay="4000"></div>
